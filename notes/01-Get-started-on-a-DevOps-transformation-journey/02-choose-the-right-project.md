Notes on Choosing the Right DevOps Project:

1. **Learning Objectives**:
   - Understand various projects and systems for DevOps implementation.
   - Select a suitable project for starting DevOps transformation.
   - Identify groups to minimize resistance to change.
   - Determine key project metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

2. **Greenfield vs. Brownfield Projects**:
   - **Greenfield**: New projects without existing constraints.
     - Easier to implement new practices.
     - Potential to avoid entrenched business processes.
   - **Brownfield**: Projects with existing codebases and team dynamics.
     - More challenging due to technical debt and established processes.
     - Significant opportunity for impactful transformation.

3. **Choosing Between Project Types**:
   - **Greenfield Projects**: Ideal for a fresh start, but may lack immediate business impact.
   - **Brownfield Projects**: Offer tangible improvement opportunities in existing critical systems.
   - Decision based on organizational needs, readiness for change, and potential impact.

4. **Systems of Record vs. Systems of Engagement**:
   - **Systems of Record**: Prioritize accuracy and security, evolve slowly.
   - **Systems of Engagement**: Emphasize agility, frequent modifications.
   - DevOps practices applicable to both, with potentially greater impact on Systems of Record.

5. **Minimizing Initial Resistance**:
   - Identify and involve canary users and early adopters.
   - Roll out changes incrementally for manageable transformation.
   - Target improvements that are achievable, measurable, and impactful.

6. **Project Metrics and KPIs**:
   - **Efficiency**: Deployment frequency, server-to-admin ratio, staff-to-customer ratio, application usage and performance.
   - **Quality and Security**: Deployment and application failure rates, mean time to recover, bug report rates, defect escape rate, SLA achievements.
   - **Culture**: Employee morale, retention rates.
   - **Outcome Focused**: Choose metrics that align with business outcomes and ROI.

7. **Summary**:
   - Essential to understand different types of projects and systems for effective DevOps transformation.
   - Identifying right project type and system, minimizing resistance, and focusing on specific metrics are key to successful implementation.
